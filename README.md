# Assignment Brief: K6 – The Fundamentals of Data Structures, Database System Design, Implementation and Maintenance

## Title  
**Understanding and Applying Data Structures and Database Design**

---

## Aim  
To demonstrate your understanding of how data is stored, organised, and maintained within a business environment. This task will assess your knowledge of data structures and how databases are designed, implemented, and kept accurate and secure.

---

## Learning Outcome – K6  
**Understand the fundamentals of data structures, database system design, implementation and maintenance.**

You must explain and provide examples for the following areas:

### Data Structures:
- **Linear Data Structures:**  
  - Arrays  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Stacks  
  - Queues  
- **Non-linear Data Structures:**  
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  

### Database Design and Implementation:
- Tables and relationships (including **foreign keys**)
- Choosing **correct data types**
- Understanding and avoiding **anomalies** (Insert, Update, Delete)
- Applying **normalisation** up to **Third Normal Form (3NF)**

### Database Maintenance:
- **Backups and recovery**
- Managing **clean data vs. dirty data**

## Task Overview  
You are working as part of a team that manages business information systems. Your manager has asked you to prepare a report that explains how data is structured and managed, including examples from your work or a fictional scenario. Your report should show:

1. What each type of data structure is and when it would be used  
2. How databases are designed and built using correct methods  
3. What steps are taken to keep data reliable and accurate over time

## Report Structure

| Section | Guidance |
|--------|----------|
| **1. Introduction** | Provide a short overview of why data structure and database design matter in business. Include the purpose of your report. |
| **2. Data Structures** | Use subheadings for each structure (e.g., *2.1 Arrays*, *2.2 Trees*). Describe what each one is, where it’s used, and provide an example (real or fictional). |
| **3. Database Design and Implementation** | Explain how a database is built. Include: <br> - Tables, relationships and **foreign keys** <br> - Choosing the **right data types** <br> - Types of **anomalies** (Insert, Update, Delete) and how to avoid them <br> - An explanation of **normalisation up to 3NF**, with examples |
| **4. Database Maintenance** | Describe how businesses keep data secure and clean. Include examples of: <br> - Backups and restoring data <br> - Spotting and fixing **dirty data** (incorrect, duplicate, or missing values) |
| **5. Conclusion** | Summarise the importance of good design and maintenance. Reflect on how well-structured data helps with business efficiency and decision-making. |

## Submission Requirements

- A written report (suggested length: **1,000–1,500 words**)  
- Diagrams or tables to explain structures and database layouts  
- Clearly labelled examples or screenshots (if from your own work)  
- References if external resources are used

## Assessment Criteria (K6)

| Requirement | Must Be Evidenced |
|------------|--------------------|
| Explanation of linear and non-linear data structures | ✅ |
| Description of database design features (e.g. foreign keys, data types, anomalies) | ✅ |
| Understanding and application of normalisation (up to 3NF) | ✅ |
| Discussion of maintenance (e.g. backups, clean vs dirty data) | ✅ |
| Real or fictional examples used to demonstrate understanding | ✅ |
| Clear structure and professional presentation | ✅ |

**Note:** AI tools can be used to check spelling or format your report, but all descriptions and examples must be in your own words. If you use any sources, list them properly at the end.
