# Assignment Brief: K6 – The Fundamentals of Data Structures, Database System Design, Implementation and Maintenance

## Title  
**Understanding and Applying Data Structures and Database Design in a Business Environment**

---

## Aim  
To produce a clear, professional report that demonstrates your understanding of how data is stored, organised, and maintained in the workplace. This includes your knowledge of data structures and how databases are designed, implemented, and maintained to support business activity.

---

## Learning Outcome – K6  
**Understand the fundamentals of data structures, database system design, implementation and maintenance.**

---

## Background (Work-Based Scenario)

As part of your role, you are expected to work with systems that manage, store, and process data. Your manager has asked you to produce a short report that:

- Outlines your understanding of different data structures and when to use them
- Explains how your team can improve its use of database systems
- Includes examples drawn from your actual work environment where possible

This report may inform how your team handles data, trains new staff, or audits current systems.

## Report Format & Structure

This is a **professional business report** intended for an internal audience. Use clear sections, short paragraphs, and professional tone. Diagrams, examples, and labels should be used where they help communicate ideas.

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. Introduction** | Set the scene. Why does your team or department rely on data? What’s the purpose of this report? |
| **2. Data Structures** | Explain each structure: what it is, how it works, and where it could be applied in your role (e.g. queues in scheduling, stacks in error tracking). Use real examples where possible. |
| **3. Database Design and Implementation** | Describe how structured data is managed in your team: <br> - Use of tables and foreign keys <br> - Why choosing correct data types matters <br> - Risks from anomalies and how normalisation prevents them <br> - Include a simple ERD or visual if appropriate |
| **4. Database Maintenance** | Show your awareness of how your organisation protects and maintains data: <br> - Regular backups and testing recovery processes <br> - Steps taken to identify and clean dirty data (e.g. duplicate names or missing contact info) |
| **5. Conclusion** | Reflect on the impact of well-managed data: how does it support your team’s work? How does good data design reduce errors, save time, or support better decision-making? |
