## Report Format

This is a professional report and should follow a structured layout. Use clear headings, professional language, and where appropriate, tables or diagrams.

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. Introduction** | Briefly outline why data structure and database design are important in your role and organisation. |
| **2. Data Structures** | Use subheadings (e.g. `2.1 Arrays`). For each one, explain what it is, when it is useful, and link it to a task, dataset, or process in your job. |
| **3. Database Design and Implementation** | Describe how structured data is managed in your team or organisation. Include:<br> - How tables relate using foreign keys<br> - Why selecting the correct data types matters<br> - Anomalies and how normalisation helps<br> - A basic example ERD (if relevant) |
| **4. Database Maintenance** | Describe how your organisation ensures data is safe, backed up, and accurate. Include real examples (e.g. how duplicates are handled or how backups are done). |
| **5. Conclusion** | Summarise the value of good data design and maintenance in your job. How does it support business efficiency, decision-making, or accuracy? |
