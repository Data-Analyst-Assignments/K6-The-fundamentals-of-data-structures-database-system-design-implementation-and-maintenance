# Assignment Brief: K6 – The Fundamentals of Data Structures, Database System Design, Implementation and Maintenance

## Title  
**Understanding and Applying Data Structures and Database Design**

---

## Aim  
To demonstrate your understanding of how data is stored, organised, and maintained within a business setting. This task will assess your knowledge of data structures and how databases are designed, built, and kept accurate and secure.

---

## Learning Outcome – K6  
**Understand the fundamentals of data structures, database system design, implementation and maintenance.**

You must explain and give examples for the following:

### Data Structures
- **Linear Data Structures:**
  - Arrays  
  - Linked Lists  
  - Stacks  
  - Queues  
- **Non-linear Data Structures:**
  - Trees  
  - Graphs  

---

### Database Design and Implementation
- Tables and relationships (including **foreign keys**) - <a href="https://youtu.be/8wUUMOKAK-c?si=A7YNrYVGzYEkDAAR" target="_blank">Watch this video explanation</a>   
- Choosing the **right data types**  
- Understanding and avoiding **anomalies** (Insert, Update, Delete) and applying **normalisation up to Third Normal Form (3NF)** – <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFQaEYEc8_8" target="_blank">Watch this video explanation</a>

### Database Maintenance
- **Backups and recovery**  
- Managing **clean data vs. dirty data**

---

## Task Overview  
You are part of a team that manages business information systems. Your manager has asked you to write a **report** that explains how data is structured and managed. You should include examples from your real job or create a fictional example.

Your report should cover:

1. What each type of data structure is and when to use it  
2. How to design and build a database properly  
3. How to keep data clean, reliable, and safe over time

## Report Structure

| Section | What to Include |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. Introduction** | A short overview of why data structures and databases matter in business. Say what your report will cover. |
| **2. Data Structures** | Use subheadings like: `2.1 Arrays`, `2.2 Trees`, etc. For each one: explain what it is, when it’s useful, and give an example. |
| **3. Database Design and Implementation** | Explain how to build a database properly. Cover: <br> - Tables and relationships (**foreign keys**) <br> - Picking the right **data types** <br> - The different **anomalies** (Insert, Update, Delete) and how to stop them <br> - What **normalisation up to 3NF** means and why it matters – use examples |
| **4. Database Maintenance** | Explain how businesses keep data **safe and clean**. Include examples of: <br> - Backups and how to restore lost data <br> - Spotting and fixing **dirty data** (like wrong, missing, or duplicate values) |
| **5. Conclusion** | Sum up why good data design and maintenance are important. Explain how well-managed data helps the business make better decisions. |

## Submission Checklist

✅ **Length**: 1,000–1,500 words  
✅ **Use diagrams or tables** to explain complex ideas (like how a table links to another or how data flows)  
✅ **Add screenshots or real examples** if you can (make sure they are clear and labelled)  
✅ **Use your own words** – if you look things up, list the sources at the end  
✅ **Professional formatting** – use headings, bullet points and short paragraphs
